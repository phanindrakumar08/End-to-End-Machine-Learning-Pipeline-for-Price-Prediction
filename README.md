# End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline for Price Prediction with ZenML & MLflow
This project builds a full-fledged, production-ready ML pipeline for house price prediction, integrating Factory and Strategy design patterns to enhance flexibility and scalability. Leveraging ZenML for workflow orchestration and MLflow for experiment tracking and model deployment, it ensures a structured and reproducible MLOps approach.

# ðŸ”¥ What Sets This Apart?
Design Pattern-Driven Architecture: Implements Factory and Strategy design patterns for modularity and maintainability.


End-to-End EDA & Feature Engineering: Comprehensive data exploration, transformation, and selection to extract meaningful insights.


Robust ML Training & Deployment: Fine-tuned ML models optimized using automated hyperparameter tuning and seamlessly deployed.


Scalable & Reproducible: Designed for scalability, allowing easy adaptability to different datasets and business use cases.


This isnâ€™t just another house price prediction modelâ€”it's a blueprint for real-world, production-grade ML pipelines. ðŸš€
